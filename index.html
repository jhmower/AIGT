		<p>It can be tough being an introvert. You often look around and wonder how people make it through the world or how they seem to automatically know what to do in certain situations. Well the reality of it is that for the most part, everyone else is figuring it out too. They may be better at hiding it, but they don't get it either. So to put your fears at rest, I've made this website with articles on how to navigate through some of lifes toughest obstical courses. Courses like <a href="buyingshoes.html">Buying Shoes</a>, <a href="makingfriends.html">Making Friends</a>, and so on.
