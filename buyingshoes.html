<h1>Buying Shoes</h1>

<div class="article">When buying shoes (as well as other apperal), it can be hard to choose from all the options. When I get shoes I try to abide by some basic rules. 

<ol>
	<li>Don&#8217;t get gloss (shiny). Getting gloss often a mistake. The gloss wears out faster and when it does, it looks worse than the non-gloss. You also want to be careful around neon. Neon is meant to attract attention, so if you don&#8217;t want that you might consider a different pair.<p>
    
    <li>You should never pay full price for anything, especially shoes
	As a general rule, you shouldn&#8217;t pay the original price for anything. There&#8217;s always some sort of discount, or sale. Shoes are one of the easier things to find deals for. When you&#8217;re looking at shoes, consider the price and if it&#8217;s too expensive, find another pair. If you&#8217;re set on a particular one, then look at different stores. Talk to an employee or cashier and say something like &quot;I&#8217;d really like to buy these, but they&#8217;re just to expensive. Are there any discounts, sales, or deals you can help me get?&quot;. If not, walk away. Them seeing you walk away might persuade them, and if it doesn&#8217;t, you still have your money. Go to another place and try again. Never underestimate the power of the internet. Online stores can often have better deals; be cautious however, sometimes they&#8217;re even pricier. Also on the internet are websites with coupons and locations of deals.<p>

    <li>Don&#8217;t waste money on shoes you already have
	The Art of Manliness has a good article on the 3 basic shoes you need <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/09/21/minimal-wardrobe-3-pairs-shoes-man-needs/">http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/09/21/minimal-wardrobe-3-pairs-shoes-man-needs/</a> . The list they have are: dress shoes, work boots, and social shoes (like converse). The ones I try to keep in stock are: sneakers (can be used for running, or if they&#8217;re new and nice, for social situations), snow boots (I live in Utah, so snow is a common occurrence), flip flops (I use an extremely cheap pair. You can find them for under $5 sometimes), dress shoes, and an old pair of shoes for getting down and dirty (for things like lawn mowing, mud, and so on). If you already have all the shoes you need, then don&#8217;t buy more. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, some people like spending money on video games, or cars, but just make sure it&#8217;s not money you need for something essential.<p>

    <li>Buy the durable and versatile
	One of the best ways to save money is to buy things that last. You get to use them longer and they need less fixing and replacing, generally for a small amount more. The more uses something has the less you of them you have to buy. These rules apply to shoes especially. When your nice casual shoes wear out, use them as around the house. When those get old, use them to mow the lawn. When those wear out, see if there&#8217;s anything else you can use them for. When their at the bottom of the chain, see how long you can get them to last. Buying things that are versatile, is equally good. If you need shoes for hiking, get some hiking boots. But see if they can also double as snow shoes. Or use your work or exercise shoes for hiking. Either way it saves you from having to buy another pair. 
</ol>
	<p>Well that covers it. Over time come up with your own strategies and methods. The most important thing is to think through what you&#8217;re getting. After that just learn from experience.
